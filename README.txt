This repository contains the source code for modding in Minecraft.

It follows the tutorials set by turtywurty on Youtube, who can be found by entering the following link:

My hope is that by following these tutorial I will learn:
   1. To create my own mods in Minecraft.
   2. Better understand Java
   
I am using Java 8 in order to load some of the Java APIs.

Java APIs are libraries, classes and constructors.
